This set of measurements was taken with Xcode 11.0 beta 2, on two different
iPhones 7 Plus: one running iOS 10.3.2 and one running iOS 11.0 beta 2. In each
case, the sample with the Bold Text setting disabled was taken, then the
setting was enabled (restarting the iPhone) and the second sample was taken.
